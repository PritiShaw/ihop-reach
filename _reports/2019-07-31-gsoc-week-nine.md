My Second Evaluation feedback was positive and I am thankful to my mentor Augustin, for constantly supporting me.  
For the past few weeks, the work has reduced a bit as compared to last month as my classes have started, but this has not affected my motivation to contribute to Open Source.

## Work Progress

In the past week, I have utilized my time to improve the documentation of the project.  
The GraphiQL IDE UX has been improved, it now allows the user to share the query by sending the URL.

## Conclusion

In the coming week, I hope that we can start the Pipeline script which will process the PMC articles. Following this step we will import these extracted files to MongoDB, thus our application will be serving the latest articles present in PubMed Central.
