The focus of the past week was to create a prototype and test it. I am thankful to my mentor, Augustin Luna for giving time and his valuable advice.<br>
The prototype was deployed on [Surge](https://surge.sh) and it was tested by my mentor. Work on search was emphasized, as it a vital component of every application.

## Work Progress

**Developing the Web Application**

Status: **Prototype Deployed**<br>
The main target for this week was to deploy a working prototype using a subset of the database. For achieving this, we started working on the search functionality. After a discussion of the options available for implementing search, we chose *[Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/)* due to it's simplicity and it does not have any other dependency.

Certain suggested modifications were implemented, and a basic prototype was [deployed](http://ihop-reach.surge.sh) using Surge.

## Conclusion

Our focus this week was to make a prototype so that we could test the capabilities of tools we are using for developing the application.<br>
In the coming week, our focus shifts towards setting up the production database servers.
