A few days back I was filling up my first evaluation form and now its time for the second one. Time indeed flies when you're having fun.  
Second Evaluation marks the end of two-third of the program. I hope I have performed up to the mark.  

## Work Progress


1. **Data Generation Pipeline**

    *    Rough flowchart for the pipeline and the [prototype](https://gist.github.com/RohitChattopadhyay/d24cd8b18f7f4a77c730b8dd813923ba) for the script was made. The script will help us to run `CLULAB REACH` in multiple machines simultaneously.
    *    A Pull Request ([indra#916](https://github.com/sorgerlab/indra/pull/916)) was sent to the `sorgerlab/INDRA` repository. This PR included more information required by our static site, in the existing `Index_Card` format.

2. **GraphQL API**  
    A major bug was raised by our users, it has been resolved.
    *    [Missing journal_title and publication_year in API](https://github.com/cannin/ihop-reach/issues/63)


## Conclusion

This week I had relocated to Kolkata as my University classes have begun. As we enter into Phase III of GSoC, I hope that I will be able to maintain my academic as well as Open Source commitments.  
Once the data-generation pipeline is set up and working, our database will be updated with the latest biomedical articles. This is a significant step for the project.
