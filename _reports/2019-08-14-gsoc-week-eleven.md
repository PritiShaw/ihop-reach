We have started processing the smallest file the from `PubMed FTP` , it is expected to take around 2 weeks to complete. As it is the first time, hence it is taking more time, I expect it to take less time eventually.  

### Preparing for the Open Source journey  
Hard to believe that GSoC19 is coming to an end, but it is leaving behind some able contributors, I hope I am one of them. GSoC has made me a better contributor, now I feel more confident in exploring the Open Source community. I no longer hesitate to communicate with people and share my ideas.  
To give back to the community and further help it grow, I along with my friends have started an Open Source Society in our University. I hope we can deliver quality tools and contribute to the community and spark the fire among our juniors so that more student contributors enter the Open Source World.
