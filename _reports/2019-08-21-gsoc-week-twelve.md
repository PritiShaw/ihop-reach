Hard to believe that I am now in the Final Evaluations of the program. Probably these three months went fastest in my life.  
I have learnt a lot from the program and has even increased my respect and eagerness to contribute to the Open Source Community.

## Pipeline Updates
The FTP files are being processed using [CLULAB/REACH](https://github.co/clulab/reach) processor. For the current archive file, we will process around 900,000 articles, out of which around 700,000 articles have been already processed. I expect it to take 6 days more to be at a stage where we can import them to our MongoDB database.
